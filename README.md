# Philio PAT02-1B SmartThings

Hello all,

This is my first published device handler, so I welcome any advice or suggestions.
This is based on other peoples handlers with modifications to make it work for this device. I have removed most of the unnecessary code although there are a couple of sections, which I have commented, which may still be unnecessary.
I have had it running for a while and it seems to all work...

...but I have no real experience of Groovy or SmartThings, so if there are better ways of doing things please let me know?

This reports on the four "sensors" that this device supports; temperature, humidity, battery and the tamper switch (which triggers if the device is removed from the wall).
